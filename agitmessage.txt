Removed variable vpc1_cidr it is not used

resource "ibm_is_security_group_rule" "sg1_tcp_rule_22" {
  depends_on = ["ibm_is_floating_ip.floatingip1", "ibm_is_floating_ip.floatingip2"]
  Are you sure these depends_on are needed?
  All the depends in main.tf can be removed

These are not used so should not be required
    iaas_classic_username = "${var.iaas_classic_username}"
    iaas_classic_api_key  = "${var.iaas_classic_api_key}"
    ibmcloud_api_key      = "${var.ibmcloud_api_key}"Consider:

Not needed for schematics execution:
    ibmcloud_api_key      = "${var.ibmcloud_api_key}"

Why are some varilables in the provider.tf file?

ssh public/prvate key pair needs to be created in advance, include the url that describes this.

At end of task3 explain how to test the resources

Consider:
- Use image name instead of ID.  Image IDs are region specific.
- Not using the default vpc SG
